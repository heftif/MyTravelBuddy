# MyTravelBuddy - .NET MAUI Test Projekt
This is the repository for my App called "MyTravelBuddy". 

## Description
.NET MAUI is a cross-platform framework for creating mobile and desktop apps with C# and XAML. Using .NET MAUI, you can develop apps that can run on Android, iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and Windows from a single shared codebase.

This app allows you to schedule your upcoming trips from the main screen. You are then automatically provided with "ToDo" items (for which push notifications can be enabled) that should be done before you leave for your trip.
It also allows you to set up a daily plan for your trip, add documents and visualize your route. The newest feature allows reading of calender events and will it is planned to be used in replacement of manually searching for
your destination address. 

The App stores the information on a local database using sqlite.
